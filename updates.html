			07-06-2023: I went back to an older program called NL-APTM (NewmanLab-Accession Processor and Table Maker) and updated it to selenium. Had to rewrite a lot of it but it works again now so that is good. made a new page for the downloads and updated this website to showcase it, might add some pictures. it currently is console only, so I'm working on making it compatable with the GUI of NLTNC.<br>
			<br>
			07-05-2023: I've switched the program from just JSoup doing everything to Selenium scraping and JSoup for processing the data. This makes the program more accurate as it scrapes the dynamic content from the NCBI webpage, but it also makes it slower. Way slower. Working on a way to improve speed and some other things :) <br>
			<br>
			07-02-2023: I've fixed the GUI issues, so that's good. There are still some stuff I need to tweak in the program though... <br>
